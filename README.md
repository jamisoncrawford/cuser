# Package 'cuser'

R package to streamline (pre)processing tasks for Syracuse-specific, social sector data.

<br>

## Functions

The following functions are currently available in `cuser`.

<br>

### Clean, Filter, & Order DSS Temporary Assistance Data

Function `filter_ta()` processes tables of class `data.frame` by filtering data 
exlusively to the 55 census tracts within Syracuse, NY, and ordering values 
according to Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 6-4 (FIPS) GEOID.

Lastly, `filter_ta()` presevres census tracts which exclude Temporary Assistance 
(TA) data that are not reported by Onondaga County Department of Social Services (DSS).

<br>

### Detect & Validate Syracuse, NY Census Tract Format Variants

Function `expand_ct()` automatically detects the format of any array of Syracuse, NY's 
55 census tracts and returns a table of class `data.frame` with the original data, 
in addition to four alternative formats, as well as providing the option to alphanumeric 
ordering, removal of missing values, and removal of duplicate values.
